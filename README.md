# Neovim config
This repo contains my neovim config written from scratch. It supports syntax highliting and autocompletion.

## Setup
There are some requirements in order for this neovim config to work:
- npm
- unzip
- build-essential (or some C/C++ compilers for windows)

to get the location where to clone this repo:
open nvim
type:
```shell
:echo stdpath("config")
```

and you will have the location of the neovim config directory
